Indicator ID: IND_SHR
Indicator Name: Shrub Ratio
Type: TYPE A (ratio mode)

Description:
    The Shrub Ratio (SHR) quantifies the proportion of shrub and low-growing 
    plant pixels visible in street-level imagery. It measures the visual 
    presence of understory vegetation, hedges, bushes, and ornamental plants 
    in the urban landscape. Shrubs provide important ecological services 
    including habitat for small wildlife, air quality improvement, noise 
    reduction, and aesthetic enhancement. Unlike tree canopy coverage, shrub 
    coverage represents ground-level greenery that directly interacts with 
    pedestrians and contributes to street-level visual quality.

Formula: SHR = (Sum(Shrub_Pixels) / Sum(Total_Pixels)) × 100

Variables:
    - Shrub_Pixels: Pixels classified as shrubs, bushes, and low plants
    - Total_Pixels: Total number of pixels in the image

References:
    - First confirmed by: Urban vegetation studies using semantic segmentation
    - Related to: IND_GVI (Green View Index), but focuses specifically on 
      understory vegetation rather than all vegetation types

    Calculate the Shrub Ratio (SHR) for a semantic segmentation mask image.
    
    TYPE A - ratio mode: (target_pixels / total_pixels) × 100
    
    The function reads a semantic segmentation mask image, counts pixels 
    classified as shrubs and low-growing plants, and calculates their 
    proportion relative to the total image area.

            - 'total_pixels' (int): Total pixel count in the image
            - 'class_breakdown' (dict): Pixel count for each shrub class
            - 'error' (str): Error message if success is False
